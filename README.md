# Surfs Up
Performing analysis on Hawaii temperatures to uncover seasonal trends.
## Overview of Project
This weeks challenge helps us build upon our skills learned in this weeks module. For deliverables, the client wanted additional information analyzed about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu were investigated in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

The analysis had few tasks. For Deliverable 1 and Deliverable 2 Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, date data was filtered from the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June and December. Then each month's tepmerature were convereted to a list and dataframe to generate the summary statistics.

Based on the functionality of this script, it's propose can be used for other elections big or small. It would be an interesting parameter to see the geographical location of each person who voted and create a heat map. This will give valuable information of where to do more outreaching to get a more wholistic representation of the local population. The limitations of this dataset are that they only limit a few parameters. It would also be interesting to see the age groups and genders that participated in the election so that the parties can go about better strategizing for target audiences they struggled.
